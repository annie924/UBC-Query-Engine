Team Agreement:
1. We will schedule a time every two days to meet with each other online through Discord. If needed, we will meet in person before the normal lecture time. In the first meeting, we will confirm the exact meeting time and discuss the project. We can message each other if we have a problem outside of the scheduled time. We will respond within the same day.
2. We would like to start work early and distribute work evenly throughout the timeline. We will finish the task the day before the deadline. Just in case everything is going well and we have time to change and correct.
3. We will have a meeting when we encounter an issue. Any time that we both have spare will be good.
4. We will push our own work once we finish the implementation and fully test the functionality. If there are errors we can't figure out, we will comment on them and discuss the problem in the following meeting.
5. If one of us has heavy workload period and busy on testing, we will discuss the process and maybe split the work again.
6. Enjoy the project!
